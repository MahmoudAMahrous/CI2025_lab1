Hello!

I hope you will have some fun looking at my humble work on this lab
I tried to let my hill climb function work on the 2nd and 3rd problems for a long period, but my m1 mac air literally froze to death :'D
for some reason it works on smaller sets of items / sacks, but for the larger sets as in the 2nd and 3rd problems it seems to never find a valid solutions
i suppose it needs to run for longer iterations, but i was not able to do so on my laptop, and i also think the solution itself is not very good as there's a lot of used randomness to generate the neighbors and the initial solution, this is why we are not finding valid solutions
but i am running out of time so i will have to just submit it as it is :/

thank you for reading

disclaimer:
i used chat gpt for some brainstorming and to help with python notation as i am not very used to python
